1- Shift Register Circuit:
First we select a 8-bit input string with the multiplexer, then the input is fed into the shift register with the controller bit.
It is then forwarded into the other shift register.
We read inputs from the shift register as first 8-bit set and second 8-bit sets.
Each set is concatenated with 8 zeros and fed into an 16x16 bit multiplier.
The final 16 bit output is written on the outputs.

2- Ripple Counter:
As my number evaluates into - > 19070001001 mod 16 = 4 => 4 + 11 = 15
This counter should count from 0 to 15.
To achieve this i reset the counter when the 5th bit turns into one.
01111 becomes the final output and then the output is frozen.
(I couldn't achieve the resetting without asyncs so the output doesn't return to 0 after 15)
(It frozes when it hits 15)
